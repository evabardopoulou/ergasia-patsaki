English has developed over the course of more than 1,400 years.
 The earliest forms of English, a group of West Germanic Ingvaeonic dialects brought to Great Britain by anglo-Saxon settlers in the 5th century, are collectively called Old English. 
 Middle English began in the late 11th century with the Norman conquest of England; this was a period in which the language was influenced by French. Early Modern English began in the late 15th century with the introduction of the printing press to London, the printing of the King James Bible and the start of the Great Vowel Shift. Modern English has been spreading around the world since the 17th century by the worldwide influence of the British Empire and the United States.
 Through all types of printed and electronic media of these countries, English has become the leading language of international discourse and the lingua franca in many regions and professional contexts such as science, navigation and law
